# CAN 2019 Cover Artwork
 
Cover image was created with Processing, using 500 images scraped from CAN’s 2019 archive of projects. Using a gradient background and a blurred ‘2019’ type, images were arranged according to their average brightness and matched to the position of gradient pixels. 

Based on Dan Shiffman’s ‘Obamathon’ – source code and tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnlAH1zDBDE).
